Analyze learning progress and provide educational insights:

Parameters:
- Optional: `--subject "topic name"` to focus on specific learning area
- Optional: `--period 30d` (default) or `7d`, `90d` for analysis timeframe

Steps:
1. Scan learning notes in `30-Knowledge/Learning/` folder
2. Analyze daily notes for learning-related activities
3. Extract learning metrics:
   - Note creation frequency and topics
   - Knowledge connections and cross-references
   - Learning sources and methods used
   - Completed learning tasks and projects
4. Evaluate learning effectiveness:
   - Knowledge retention patterns
   - Topic mastery progression
   - Learning velocity by subject
   - Active recall and spaced repetition usage
5. Identify learning patterns:
   - Peak learning times and conditions
   - Most effective learning methods
   - Knowledge gaps and missing connections
   - Abandoned or incomplete learning paths
6. Generate improvement recommendations:
   - Optimal learning schedule suggestions
   - Subject-specific study strategies
   - Knowledge consolidation opportunities
   - Next learning priorities and goals
7. Create learning dashboard with progress visualization

Output includes: learning velocity charts, knowledge map analysis, mastery assessments, and personalized study plan recommendations for continuous improvement.
